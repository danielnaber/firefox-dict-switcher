# Automatic Dictionary Switcher Add-on for Firefox

**NOTICE** This add-on does not work pending a [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1240536) and is therefore not available as an add-on for Firefox. Please, see the following alternatives:
* [Automatic Spelling Language](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/automatic-spelling-language/) for Firefox
* [Automatic Dictionary](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/automatic-dictionary-switching/) for Thunderbird

**END OF NOTICE**

Based on the text entered in a textarea, this add-on automatically detects the
language and sets the corresponding spell checking dictionary. You need to type
at least 25 characters before the add-on will start. Before that limit is
reached, it disables spell checking. A small icon on the extension's icon
will give you feedback about the language that has been detected.
